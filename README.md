# Wifi_Flux
git remote rm origin

I have had a few assumptions while designing the application so I wanted to clear up my thought process before moving into the application.
 - I am under the assumption that the Wifi network will not broadcast it's SSID so I had the application automatically connect to the Wifi SSID
 -and passkey provided.
 
 -I was not able to fully develop the application in the Flux architecture because of the simplicity of the application, I did not see an 
 -obvious way to implement the Flux architecture without greatly exagerating the complexity of the application due to it's simplicity. 
 
 -If there is a better way to implement this please let me know and if you have any examples please share them, 
 I am very interested and would love to learn more about that implementation.
 
 Thank you for the opportunity, it has been quite a fun and enjoyable experiance. Hope to hear from you all soon.
